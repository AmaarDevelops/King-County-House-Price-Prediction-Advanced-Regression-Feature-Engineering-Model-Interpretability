King County House Price Prediction: Advanced Regression, Feature Engineering & Model Interpretability üè°
This project focuses on predicting house sale prices in King County, Washington (Seattle area), using a comprehensive machine learning approach. It demonstrates a full workflow from data cleaning and advanced feature engineering to robust model training, hyperparameter tuning, and crucial model interpretability.

üöÄ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a highly accurate predictive model for house prices. We leverage a rich dataset of house sales from King County, incorporating geographical, temporal, and structural features to enhance prediction accuracy and gain insights into the factors influencing property values.

‚ú® Key Features & Skills Demonstrated
Data Loading & Initial Exploration (EDA):

Basic data inspection (.info(), .describe(), .isnull().sum()) to understand dataset structure and identify missing values.

Advanced Feature Engineering:

Temporal Features: Extraction of sale_year, sale_month, sale_day_of_week, sale_quarter from the date column.

Age & Renovation: Calculation of house_age and years_since_renovation to capture property lifecycle.

Geospatial Insights:

distance_to_center: Calculated Euclidean distance from each property to the geographical center of King County.

region: Application of K-Means Clustering on zipcode coordinates to group similar geographical areas into distinct regions, providing a high-level location feature.

Ratio Features: Creation of sqft_living_per_lot and bathrooms_per_bedroom to represent property density and bathroom density per living space.

Combined Area: total_square_footage combining above-ground and basement areas.

Polynomial Features: Generation of interaction terms and higher-order terms (sqft_living, grade, house_age) using sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures to capture non-linear relationships.

Robust Data Preprocessing:

Categorical Encoding:

Ordinal Encoding: Applied OrdinalEncoder to ordered categorical features (view, condition, grade).

Robust One-Hot Encoding: Implemented a strategic approach to OneHotEncode nominal categorical features (zipcode, waterfront, region), ensuring consistent column structures between training and testing sets, even if categories are unevenly distributed.

Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features, crucial for distance-based and regularization-sensitive models.

Train-Test Split: Proper splitting of data before scaling and complex encoding to prevent data leakage.

Model Training & Comparison:

Evaluated multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Utilized standard evaluation metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared (Coefficient of Determination).

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Performed GridSearchCV for exhaustive hyperparameter search on the RandomForestRegressor to optimize its performance.

Model Interpretability with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):

Used the SHAP library with the best-performing RandomForestRegressor to understand feature importance and individual prediction contributions.

Visualized global feature importance (SHAP bar plot) and individual feature impact (SHAP beeswarm plot).

Comprehensive Visualizations:

Histograms to visualize feature distributions.

Correlation Heatmap to understand relationships between features and the target variable (price).

Residual Plot: Diagnosed model errors by plotting residuals against predicted values.

Predicted vs. Actual Plot: Visually assessed model accuracy by comparing predicted prices against true prices.

üìä Results & Insights

(After running the script, you would fill this section with your specific findings)

The Tuned Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance among the models, with an R-squared of X.XX, RMSE of Y.YY, and MAE of Z.ZZ.

SHAP analysis revealed that sqft_living, grade, and bathrooms were consistently among the most influential features affecting house prices.

house_age and distance_to_center also played significant roles, highlighting the importance of the engineered features.

The residual plot showed a generally uniform distribution, indicating that the model captures most of the variance without obvious biases, though some larger errors might exist at higher price ranges.

The predicted vs. actual plot showed a strong linear relationship, confirming the model's predictive power.

üöÄ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/King-County-House-Price-Prediction.git
